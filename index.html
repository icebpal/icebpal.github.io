            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p> Frankly, I am not great with Github, coming from only committing things for my several school classes for my Computer Science degree. Therefore,
              I find it very difficult to actually try and create a website using technologies like React on here. So I will be trying to create simple enough site mainly focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
              but I am so doubtful to the point that it will probably be 90% HTML even though I am familiar with so many other front end technologies. </p>
            <p> <strong> Please enjoy this CSS and styleless site for now :) </strong> </p>
